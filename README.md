# Try different experiment with scala.js

## Rendering + simple physics engine  
 Visualisation objects with using different forces (gravity with mass, friction, acceleration)
 simple like 10 strokes without any dependency and frameworks
 by only using scala collections
 
[working sample](http://botgl.kotobotov.ru/) (just move your cursor on the screen)

## drawing app
the main goal was creating smooth transition between mouse movements (as it has discreet signal) 
by using the quadratic polynomial for trajectory and varying wight of the line
